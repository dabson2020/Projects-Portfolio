The first part of this project (analysis.py) is sub-divided into:
- Loading of Data with Kaggle API with Python
- Clean the data by:
  - Replacing missing values
  - Convert the columns into lowercase and replace whitespaces with underscores
  - Perform feature engineering by adding more features and dropping insignificant features
  - Change data types of some of the features
- Load the cleaned data into MS SQL Server

- Query the data and answer the following questions:
 - Question 1: Find the top 10 highest revenue-generating products
 - Question 2: find the top 5 highest-selling products per region.
 - Question 3: Find month-over-month growth comparison  for 2022 and 2023 sales. For example, Jan 2022 vs Jan 2023. Compute the difference
- Question 4: For each category, which month had the highest sales.
- Question 5: Which sub-category had the highest growth by profit in 2023 compared to 2022
