Database and database management is very essential for extracting insights from data. In this project, I used postgres library in python to create a database and warehouse data from further analysis.

- With python, the following functions were created:
 - Create the database
 - Drop tables
 - Create tables
 - Read data from multiple files
 - Data cleaning
 The cleaned data is inserted into the tables in the database

 - Postgres database was utilized to warehouse the clean data
